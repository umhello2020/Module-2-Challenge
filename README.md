# Module-2-Challenge

## Description
    This application is my portfolio for potential clients to view and learn about me. I inserted a navigation bar at the top of the page for easier navigation. There are three sections on the page: About Me, My Work, and Contact Me. The "About Me" section contains information about me, including: where I am from, what I previously did for work, what I learned from those experiences, and my outlook for this career. The "My Work" section contains images of my previous work and links to the deployed sites. The last section, "Contact Me," contains links to my github, my email, and my phone number. There are hover elements inembedded for all links except the images.

## Visuals

## Usage
    This application is to be used by future clients to learn a little more about me. While using this site they can also view some of my completed works and how to contact me. There are links within the nav bar that will take you to the dedicated section along the page. If you click on the images located in the "My Work" section, it will take you to the deployed application. At the bottom of the page in the "Contact Me" section, there are some links for you to contact me, and, if you upon clicking on the links, it will take you to the aformentioned site.
