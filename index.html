                            <p>I am Olivia Gilbert, and, after years in the food service industry and a year in healthcare, I decided that I wanted to change my career path. I wanted to set a better course in my life and change careers. Over the years, I gained an interest in computers and decided to see where it took me. Although my previous jobs were not the right fit for me, I am grateful for my background because it has provided me with necessary skills for almost any career. While working in food service, I developed avid customer service skills and gained some knowledge about time management and task prioritization. Through my work in healthcare, I bettered my skills on connecting with patients and developing a repetoire with them. </p>

                             <p>Currently I live in Smyrna, TN and I am now pursuing a career in full stack web development through this Vanderbilt coding bootcamp. I hope to gain an increased knowledge of computers and code. I am looking forward to the future possibilities with this change in career!</p>
